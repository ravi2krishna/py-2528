    -> Python which is common for all above courses [35 - 40 Days]

        -> Python Language Fundamentals    

    -> Python 

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
        significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    -> Python is a "high-level" programming language

        -> High Level Languages are "Human Understandable" Language (English)

            -> python code looks like English

                -> sum = num1 + num2 

        -> Low Level Language

            -> Low Level Languages are "Machine Understandable" Language (Binary)

                -> 010010110101111

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python
    
    -> Python is a "general-purpose" programming language

        -> If i can do multiple specific types of tasks / Applications 

        -> Using Python, we can develop different types of Applications 

            -> Desktop applications ? Yes

            -> Web Applications ? Yes 

            -> Data Oriented Applications ? Yes 

            -> API's ? Yes 

            -> Automation Scripts ? Yes 

        -> Domain Specific programming language

            -> If i can do only specific types of tasks / Applications 

            -> SQL: Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
                used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system. 


    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes "code readability" with the use of 
        significant "indentation".

        -> code readability

            Java Code 
            ---------

            class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {                    
                    int first = 10;
                    int second = 20;
                    // add two numbers
                    int sum = first + second;
                    System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                }
            }

                class 
                public 
                static 
                void 
                String 
                []
                {}
                ; 

            
            Python Code
            -----------

            first = 10
            second = 20
            sum = first + second
            print(sum)

        -> indentation

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> Python uses "spaces" for indentation 


    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

        -> Python is Dynamically type-checked

            -> We Have Data Types in programming languages 

            -> Data Type: Categorization Of Data 

                -> whole numbers, text, decimal numbers etc 

            -> Dynamically type-checked means, no need to explicitly 
                specify Data Types 

                -> product = "Apple Iphone"
                -> price = 60000
                -> rating = 4.5 
                -> etc 

        -> Java is Static type-checked

            -> Static type-checked means, you need to explicitly 
                specify Data Types 

                -> String product = "Apple Iphone";
                -> int price = 60000;
                -> double rating = 4.5 ;
                -> etc 
        
        -> Python is garbage-collected

            -> Removing / Cleaning Unused Data 

            -> Python Automatically cleans up Unused Data / Memory 

                -> product = "Apple Iphone"
                -> price = 60000
                -> rating = 4.5 

                -> print(product)
                -> print(price)

                -> NOTE: Python cleans up rating, as it's never used 

    -> Python is "Interpreted" Language 

        -> An Interpreted Language executes code "Line By Line"

    -> Java is "Compiled" Language

        -> An Compiled Language executes code "All at once"

    -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled Languages" are "FASTER"

    -> Considering above criteria, still why Python ?

        -> Python Has Vast Eco System Of Libraries 

        -> Python is Easy To Learn / Develop / Code Readability

        -> NOTE: Python is best "PROTO TYPE LANGUAGE" 

            -> With Python We Don't focus on SPEED OF Applications (Performance)

            -> With Python We focus on SPEED OF Development (Less Time To Develop)

    
    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to 
            conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.

            -> Problem: How To Reach Institute ?

                -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk 
                -> Solution 2: I'll come by Bike
                -> Solution 3: I'll come by Bus 

        -> NOTE: Python supports multiple programming paradigms

        -> We have Two Popular programming paradigms

            -> Imperative Approach 

                -> Focus in on "HOW To DO" 

                    -> Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

            -> Declarative Approach 

                -> Focus in on "WHAT To DO" 

                    -> Functional Programming 

            -> Imperative Code With Python 

                def get_user_emails(users):
                        emails = []  # Step-by-step building the result

                        for i in range(len(users)):         # Loop manually
                            user = users[i]                 # Fetch each user

                            if user.get("email") is not None:   # Check condition manually
                                emails.append(user["email"])    # Manually add to list

                        return emails


                    # Sample users list
                    users = [
                        {"name": "Mike", "email": "mike@gmail.com"},
                        {"name": "John", "email": None},
                        {"name": "Sara", "email": "sara@gmail.com"}
                    ]

                    print(get_user_emails(users))


            -> Declarative Code With Python 

                emails = [u["email"] for u in users if u["email"] is not None]

=============

    -> Python Setup 

        -> open command prompt (windows)

            -> python --version

                -> if not found, install 

            -> Install from https://www.python.org/

            -> After installing python, close command prompt and re-open 

                -> python --version


    -> Where To Write Python Code ?

        -> Command Line Mode (Not Recommended)

            -> We write code in command prompt 

            -> Temporary, once we close the session all code is reset 

                -> python 

        -> Script Mode (Recommended)

            -> We write code in files using IDE i.e Visual Studio Code 

            -> Permanently stored on Disk 

    
    -> How To Write Python Code ?

        -> Any programming language has "Syntax" (Rules)

        -> Comparing programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today at 8:00 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 8:00 AM (correct)

        -> Learn English 

            -> English has 26 Alphabets (abcd.......z)

            -> Using these Alphabets, we form Words, then Sentences, then Paragraphs 
                over a time with experience 

        -> Learn Python 

            -> Python has 35 "Keywords" (Which are equivalent to English Alphabets)

            -> Using these Keywords, we form Statements Using some syntax / rules 

            -> List Of Python keywords

                -> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

                    False      await      else       import     pass
                    None       break      except     in         raise
                    True       class      finally    is         return
                    and        continue   for        lambda     try
                    as         def        from       nonlocal   while
                    assert     del        global     not        with
                    async      elif       if         or         yield

                -> NOTE: All the above keywords hold some special meaning to Python Interpreter


    -> Python Rules / Syntax 

        -> Any python file goes with .py as extension 

        -> Python Ignores lines what start with # 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

        -> Rules 

            -> When working with numeric values (1,2,1.0,2.5 etc)
                we can directly use numerics with print()

            -> When working with text data, in python text data 
                is called as String 

                -> Strings are represented using " " or ' '


    -> Identifiers 

        -> An identifier is a "name" used to uniquely identify

            -> Variable 
            -> Function 
            -> Class 
            -> Object 
            -> etc 

        -> Identifiers Rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Special Symbols ( _ Only underscore)

            -> Must Start With 

                -> A letter or _ (underscore)

        -> NOTE: Always use proper way of naming identifiers 

    
    -> Variables 

        -> Variable is a named memory location in computers memory (RAM),
            that holds some value or data 

            -> Computer -> RAM -> Variables 

        -> Syntax 

            variable_name = value 

                -> variable_name should follow identifier rules 
                -> = called as Assignment Operator 
                -> value is data that you want to store 
            
            data = 10 
    
        -> Variables Allow You To 

            -> Assign Data (Store Data)

            -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)

            -> Manipulate Data (Change Data)

        -> Combine Variables with your custom statements 

            -> Concatenation: Joining String using + operator

            -> When Combining String With Other Data Types like int, float etc use , operator 

        -> We can verify memory location of value 

            -> use id() function 

        -> Python Memory Model 

            -> If a value is already present, python will not create a memory block
                again for the same value, rather it references existing memory block

        -> To Know Data Type In Python 

            -> use type() function

            -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)         -> DONE

            -> Manipulate Data (Change Data)    -> DO 

    -> Operators 

        -> Operators are special "Symbols" and "keywords", 
            which Performs Operations on Variables and their Values.

        -> There are different types of operator, 
            to deal with different types of data  

        -> Arithmetic Operators

            -> To Perform "Mathematical Calculations" 

            -> + - * / % 
            -> // - floor division (same as division but rounds off result)
            -> ** - Exponentiation (used to Calculate powers)

        -> Compound Assignment Operators

            -> Assignment Operator is = (used for assigning a value to Variable)

            -> Compound Assignment Operators Combines Arithmetic Operators 
                with Assignment Operators for "short hand code" (concise code)

                -> x = 10
                
                -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                -> x = x * 5 (long form)

                -> x += 5 (short form)
                -> x *= 5 (short form)

            -> In Other Programming Languages we got Increment & Decrement Operators

                -> Increment (++)
                -> Decrement (--)

                -> NOTE: Above are not supported in python

        
        -> Comparison Operators

            -> Comparison Operators are used for Comparing Values
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

                -> Especially Used In "Conditional Checks"

                -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 

        
        -> Logical Operators

            -> For Performing Logical Operations 

            -> Used to check "multiple" conditions 
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

            -> and : if both conditions are True, then only result is True, otherwise False 
            -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True, otherwise False 
            -> not : negates the result, if true then false and vice versa 

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y
                            T       T           T         T         F       F

        -> Membership Operators

            -> Used for checking if an object in in the given sequence 

                -> in : return True, if given object is in sequence

                -> not in : return True, if given object is not in sequence

        -> Identity Operators 

            -> Used for checking if both objects are same 

                -> is : return True, if objects are same 

                -> is not : return True, if objects are not same 


        -> Bitwise Operators

            -> Used in Low Level Programming (010101001)

                -> & - if both bits are 1, then result is 1
                -> | - if one the bits is 1, then result is 1

    -> Data Types 

        -> Data Types are Categorization that defines, what kind of data a variable can hold 

        -> Python is dynamic types language(assumes the type based on value)

    -> Numeric Types

        -> int : 1,2,3,0,-1,-2 etc 
        
        -> float : 3.5, 1.5, 2.1 1.0 etc

        -> NoneType : Represents nothing i.e absence of value 
    
    -> Simple Data Types : Hold Single Value in a single variable

    -> Complex Data Types : Hold Multiple Values in a single variable

        -> Sequence Types 

            -> List : List is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                        represented using []

                            represented using { } 

    -> NOTE : All above data types are "pre-defined" in python standard library 

    -> NOTE : Based on custom Requirements coming from users/customers, 
                we can create our own data types i.e "user-defined"

            -> syntax 

                class CustomDataType:
                    statements
