        -> Data Analytics / Data Science    : Data Operations (Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch)

        -> DevOps / Cloud                   : Scripting / Automation (OS, Sys, Boto3)

    
    -> Python which is common for all above courses [35 - 40 Days]

        -> Python Language Fundamentals    

    -> Python 

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
        significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    -> Python is a "high-level" programming language

        -> High Level Languages are "Human Understandable" Language (English)

            -> python code looks like English

                -> sum = num1 + num2 

        -> Low Level Language

            -> Low Level Languages are "Machine Understandable" Language (Binary)

                -> 010010110101111

            -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python
    
    -> Python is a "general-purpose" programming language

        -> If i can do multiple specific types of tasks / Applications 

        -> Using Python, we can develop different types of Applications 

            -> Desktop applications ? Yes

            -> Web Applications ? Yes 

            -> Data Oriented Applications ? Yes 

            -> API's ? Yes 

            -> Automation Scripts ? Yes 

        -> Domain Specific programming language

            -> If i can do only specific types of tasks / Applications 

            -> SQL: Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
                used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system. 


    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes "code readability" with the use of 
        significant "indentation".

        -> code readability

            Java Code 
            ---------

            class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {                    
                    int first = 10;
                    int second = 20;
                    // add two numbers
                    int sum = first + second;
                    System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                }
            }

                class 
                public 
                static 
                void 
                String 
                []
                {}
                ; 

            
            Python Code
            -----------

            first = 10
            second = 20
            sum = first + second
            print(sum)

        -> indentation

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> Python uses "spaces" for indentation 


    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

        -> Python is Dynamically type-checked

            -> We Have Data Types in programming languages 

            -> Data Type: Categorization Of Data 

                -> whole numbers, text, decimal numbers etc 

            -> Dynamically type-checked means, no need to explicitly 
                specify Data Types 

                -> product = "Apple Iphone"
                -> price = 60000
                -> rating = 4.5 
                -> etc 

        -> Java is Static type-checked

            -> Static type-checked means, you need to explicitly 
                specify Data Types 

                -> String product = "Apple Iphone";
                -> int price = 60000;
                -> double rating = 4.5 ;
                -> etc 
        
        -> Python is garbage-collected

            -> Removing / Cleaning Unused Data 

            -> Python Automatically cleans up Unused Data / Memory 

                -> product = "Apple Iphone"
                -> price = 60000
                -> rating = 4.5 

                -> print(product)
                -> print(price)

                -> NOTE: Python cleans up rating, as it's never used 

    -> Python is "Interpreted" Language 

        -> An Interpreted Language executes code "Line By Line"

    -> Java is "Compiled" Language

        -> An Compiled Language executes code "All at once"

    -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled Languages" are "FASTER"

    -> Considering above criteria, still why Python ?

        -> Python Has Vast Eco System Of Libraries 

        -> Python is Easy To Learn / Develop / Code Readability

        -> NOTE: Python is best "PROTO TYPE LANGUAGE" 

            -> With Python We Don't focus on SPEED OF Applications (Performance)

            -> With Python We focus on SPEED OF Development (Less Time To Develop)

    
    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to 
            conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.

            -> Problem: How To Reach Institute ?

                -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk 
                -> Solution 2: I'll come by Bike
                -> Solution 3: I'll come by Bus 

        -> NOTE: Python supports multiple programming paradigms

        -> We have Two Popular programming paradigms

            -> Imperative Approach 

                -> Focus in on "HOW To DO" 

                    -> Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

            -> Declarative Approach 

                -> Focus in on "WHAT To DO" 

                    -> Functional Programming 

            -> Imperative Code With Python 

                def get_user_emails(users):
                        emails = []  # Step-by-step building the result

                        for i in range(len(users)):         # Loop manually
                            user = users[i]                 # Fetch each user

                            if user.get("email") is not None:   # Check condition manually
                                emails.append(user["email"])    # Manually add to list

                        return emails


                    # Sample users list
                    users = [
                        {"name": "Mike", "email": "mike@gmail.com"},
                        {"name": "John", "email": None},
                        {"name": "Sara", "email": "sara@gmail.com"}
                    ]

                    print(get_user_emails(users))


            -> Declarative Code With Python 

                emails = [u["email"] for u in users if u["email"] is not None]

        -> Simple & Easy Readability

        -> Versatility 

            -> Data Oriented / Full Stack / Cloud etc
